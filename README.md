# AOI Website Redesign
[Visit the original website here.](http://ao-inc.com/)

## Issues
#### Gathered from company employees:
- color scheme is outdated and dark
- some pages and information are redundant
- images are pixelated and/or old
- website is not secure (https)
- font too small
- careers page outdated

## Solutions
- First change the color scheme to a brighter one without changing the structure of the page.
- Modern scrollable theme, similar to [Microsoft](microsoft.com) and [Cisco](cisco.com), for example.
- Investors are our target audience, so make the website as informative and clear as possible.
